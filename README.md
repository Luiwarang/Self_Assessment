# Self-Assessment
### - I was basically in charge of the datasets. I found both datasets we used in the project and performed the join in Postgres SQL. I also created the AWS bucket an uploaded our joined tabled there.

### - I contributed a lot to the coding in Pyspark, investigating and finding solutions where we struggled. For the rest of the roles I also participated a lot in preparing the presentation and building the dashboards in tableau, all during our meeting sessions.

### - My greatest personal challenge was to be able to understand the model we used (ALS) so to be able to complete the coding and make the result available as a dashboard.

# Team Assessment
### - We basically communicated all the time by slack and used the course hours and office hours to continue building on the project. We also used zoom to get connected on different times.

### - We had a very good Marketer so a lot of creative ideas were flowing and also a talented girl who really supported us in the machine learning model. Te team also got orginzed very well and we were able to finish the tasks on time.

# Summary of Project
### - We addressed the problem that almost all users have when trying to choose a movie they want to see and spend several minutes without knowing what to look at. We used Machine Learning ALS model to make predictions based on previous ratings of users with similar interests and we were able to create a recommendation of 5 different movies displayed in Tableau when the users selects its user id.
